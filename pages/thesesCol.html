              This paper evaluates the influence of a nineteenth-century
              French manual on the restoration of prints, drawings, and
              books to contemporary conservation philosophy and practice.
              First published in 1846, Essai sur la restauration des
              anciennes estampes et des livres rares was researched and
              written by Alfred Bonnardot (1808-1884) a writer,
              bibliophile, and historian of Paris. His manual, offering
              fellow amateurs of prints and books a nuanced range of
              clearly-described restoration procedures, found a growing
              audience that encouraged the issue of an enlarged second
              edition in 1858. At 349 pages, this second edition of the
              Essai remains the most comprehensive and detailed text on
              paper restoration of the nineteenth century in a western
              European language. The manual was translated into a German
              edition in 1859, and has since been reissued in French
              facsimile editions in 1967 and 1979. It is now available to
              anyone through Google Books on the Web. A published
              translation of the full text in English has not yet
              appeared.
